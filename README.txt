Our group project is named : The Cocktail Bible

Hosting link : https://thecocktailbible.netlify.app/

On this website you will be able to find all the cocktails that exist as well as their category,
their ingredients, instructions for preparation and tutorial videos if they exist.
By browsing through the different pages of our site, you can search for your favorite cocktails by name, ingredients or even randomly.
A tool to change the language between English and French is available!
